# EEE485-Data-Term-Project
The purpose of the term project is to use binary classification algorithms to predict if a bank client
will subscribe to a term deposit or not. It is important for the banks to know the client type who is
likely to subscribe to a term deposit in terms of time efficiency. With this information, they can contact
only these client types and get more money from the depositors in a shorter duration. Supervised
learning methods are used in this term project. The methods/algorithms that are used are K Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. Since there is a high demand
for accurate marketing campaign strategies, working on this problem may create an opportunity to
look into one of the biggest tasks in today's market.
